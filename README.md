Daniel's Sneaker Closet - Final Project for JavaScript Development!

This is a Single Page Application that uses Axios, Handlebars, and Firebase. The purpose of the applicatoin is to sell sneakers and see what is trending in sneakers. There are two main pages: For Sale & Trending.

Toggle between the two pages by clicking the "For Sale" or "Trending" button at the bottom of each  page.

The For Sale page has full CRUD functionality. I used Firebase as a "backend" database, the functionalities are to: list sneakers for sale, edit them, & mark them as sold. The app performs an HTTP request to Firebase, formats the returned information through a Handlebars template and presents the filled template to the user.

The Trending page has Read functionality. I used The Sneaker Database API, the functionality is to list upcoming sneaker releases. The app performs an HTTP Request to the API, formats the returned information through a Handlebars template and presents the filled template to the user.
